The Netflix Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning-based project designed to personalize the viewing experience for users by suggesting movies aligned with their preferences and viewing history. The system leverages user-movie interaction data to build intelligent models that predict user interest and recommend movies they are likely to enjoy.  This recommendation engine utilizes a dataset containing user IDs, movie titles, genres, and ratings. Based on this data, various algorithms—such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid model—can be applied to learn user behavior patterns.  The primary objective is to:  Improve user engagement Enhance content discovery  Reduce churn by presenting relevant and appealing content  By identifying latent patterns in user ratings, the system predicts how a user would rate unseen movies and recommends the top picks accordingly. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), Precision, and Recall are used to measure model accuracy.  Key Features: User-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies liked by similar users. Item-based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those previously liked by the user. Genre Tagging and Clustering: Enhances recommendations using genre similarity. Scalable Architecture: Suitable for integration with large-scale streaming platforms like Netflix.
